# Sorting Algorithm Analysis (Worst-Case)

This project compares **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, and **Merge Sort** based on execution time in **worst-case scenarios** using C++.

### ðŸ›  Features

- Implemented manually (no `<vector>` or `<algorithm>`)
- Uses `<chrono>` for high-precision timing
- Worst-case: arrays in reverse order
- Input sizes: 5, 10, 50, 100
- Average time from 5 runs
